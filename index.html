					 <P><ol><li ><p class="name"><strong>Work</strong> with public agencies and other organizations -- neighborhood-based or community-wide -- on solving common problems. </p></li> <li><strong> Make </strong> sure that all the youth in the neighborhood have positive ways to spend their spare time, through organized recreation, tutoring programs, part-time work, and volunteer opportunities. </li> <li><strong> Set up</strong> a <a href='http://www.ncpc.org/cms/cms-upload/ncpc/files/orgz.pdf'>Neighborhood Watch</a> or a community patrol, working with police. Make sure your streets and homes are well lighted. </li> <li><strong> Build </strong> a partnership with police, focused on solving problems instead of reacting to crises. Make it possible for neighbors to report suspicious activity or crimes without fear of retaliation.</li> <li><strong>Clean up</strong> the neighborhood! Involve everyone - teens, children, senior citizens. Litter, abandoned cars, and run-down buildings tell criminals that you don't care about where you live or each other. Call the city public works department and ask for help in cleaning up. </li> <li><strong> Ask</strong> local officials to use new ways to get criminals out of your building or neighborhood. These include enforcing anti-noise laws, housing codes, health and fire codes, anti-nuisance laws, and drug-free clauses in rental leases. </li> <li><strong> Work</strong> with schools to establish drug-free, gun-free zones; work with recreation officials to do the same for parks. </li> <li><strong> Develop and share</strong> a phone list of local organizations that can provide counseling, job training, guidance, and other services that neighbors might need. </li> <li><strong> Report</strong> a crime if you witness it or something you suspect might be a crime. Agree to testify if needed. </li> <li><strong> Learn</strong> about hotlines, crisis centers, and other help available to victims of crime. Find out how you can help those who are touched by violence to recover as quickly and completely as possible. </li> <li><strong> Recognize</strong> that it's already your problem if violence is about to erupt in your neighborhood. </li> <li><strong> Consider</strong> an event that lets children turn in weapons, especially those that might be mistaken for real firearms, in exchange for public thank-yous, donated non-violent toys, books, or coupons from local merchants.</li> <li><strong> Start</strong> a discussion of neighborhood views on weapons in the home, use of toy weapons by children in play, children and violent entertainment, and how arguments should be settled. </li> <li><strong> Learn</strong> your state and local laws on firearms. Insist that these laws be enforced vigorously but fairly. Support police, prosecutors, judges, and other local officials who enforce laws designed to prevent gun violence. </li><br />
						 <br />
 <li><strong> Emphasize</strong> prevention as the preferred way to deal with violence. Ask what schools, law enforcement agencies, public health agencies, libraries, workplaces, religious institutions, child protective agencies, and others are doing to prevent, not just react to, violence. What policies do they have to prevent weapons-related violence? How can they help the community? </li> <li><strong> Volunteer</strong> to mentor young people who need positive support from adults. Programs ranging from Big Brothers and Big Sisters to Adopt-a-School include mentoring as a central ingredient. </li> <li><strong> Talk</strong> with children in the neighborhood about what worries or scares them and about where and how they have felt threatened by violence. Interview teachers, school staff, crossing guards, and bus aides. </li> <li><strong> Promote</strong> public service advertising that offers anti-violence programs and services. Get several groups to cooperate in this effort. Include programs to help kids headed for trouble. </li> <li><strong> Protect</strong> domestic violence victims (and their children) through policies as well as laws that offer them prompt and meaningful response to calls for help and appropriate legal recourse. </li> <li><strong> Organize</strong> to help clean and repair the parks and to report suspicious and illegal activity to the police. Well-kept play equipment and organized activities can attract people back to the parks in large enough numbers to discourage illegal activities. Residents should insist that local government maintain parks, immediately repairing vandalism or other damage. </li> un</div>
